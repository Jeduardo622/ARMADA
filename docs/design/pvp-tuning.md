# PvP Demo Design Tuning

> **Status: DRAFT — pending design review.** Authored after the PvP demo
> merged (PRs #53–#56), following the Mission 07 / spectator-tuning
> precedent of writing the missing design spec against the shipped
> implementation. No values are proposed changed yet: every **Proposed**

Consolidates every design-tunable knob and placeholder constant in the
PvP demo — scenario stats, match lifecycle policy, order-entry surface,
netplay polling, and the two generated scenes. Spectator playback knobs
(shared renderer) are owned by `docs/design/spectator-tuning.md` and are
deliberately not duplicated here.

## Scenario (`src/sim/pvpScenario.ts`, mirrored in `unity/.../Core/PvpScenario.cs`)

> ⚠ Everything in this section **except `PVP_DEFAULT_SEED`** is
> **fingerprint-pinned** in `tests/pvpScenario.test.ts` AND the Unity
> EditMode suite. Changing a pinned value is a design change: update both
> fingerprint constants, the C# mirror, and re-derive the empirical
> fixtures (see Constraints). The default seed is not part of the
> fingerprint — it is pinned separately by the seed-11 fixtures and the
> C# `PvpScenario.DefaultSeed` mirror, so tuning only the seed touches
> those but neither fingerprint constant.

| Knob | Current | Proposed | Rationale / derived effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PVP_TURN_LIMIT` | 20 | keep | Focus-fire wins land around turn 6–8; 20 gives maneuver-heavy play headroom while keeping stalemates bounded. Timeout = draw. |
| `FRIGATE_HP` | 120 | keep | 4–5 round-shot hits to sink (25–30 hull per hit at opening stats: base 25 + 0–5 variance; 4 hits only at maximum variance); sets match length together with the hit chance below. |
| `FRIGATE_SAIL` | 80 | keep | Feeds base damage (`18 + floor(sail/25)` = +3) and is the chain-shot target pool. |
| `FRIGATE_CREW` | 50 | keep | Only cosmetic in v1 (boarding deferred); becomes live if boarding joins the modifier set. |
| `FRIGATE_SPEED` | 3 | keep | +1 hit chance (`floor(v/2)`), +4 base damage (`floor(v·1.5)`); speedDelta orders swing damage ±3 without a movement phase. |
| `LINE_SEPARATION` | 220 | keep | Opening range 220 → range penalty 4 → ~69% hit chance at start. The single biggest lethality lever: −50 range ≈ +1% hit per 50 units. |
| `LINE_SPREAD` | 30 | keep | ±30 y keeps the four markers visually separated at the shared 0.1 world-scale framing. |
| `WIND_DIRECTION` / `WIND_SPEED` | 90 / 0 | keep | Cosmetic in v1 (no `windMovement`); speed 0 keeps it inert even if flags flip accidentally. |
| `PVP_DEFAULT_SEED` | 11 | keep | Hot-seat only (netplay seeds server-side). **Not in the fingerprint**; pinned by the seed-11 focus-fire-vs-split fixtures (vitest + server full-match test), the C# `DefaultSeed` mirror, AND the serialized `seed` baked into `PvPHotseatDemo.unity` (regenerate the scene when tuning). |
| Modifier set | `{ chainShot: true }` | keep | **Product pin, not a tuning knob.** No movement phase by consequence; flipping `windMovement`/`ramming` in is scenario v2 and needs explicit sign-off. |

## Match lifecycle policy (`src/routes/pvp.ts`)

| Knob | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MATCH_WAITING_TTL_MS` | 30 min | keep | How long a join code stays live. Generous for share-a-code-over-chat; not so long that dead lobbies pile up. |
| `MATCH_IN_PROGRESS_TTL_MS` | 60 min | keep | Idle time (no submission) before an in-progress match expires. Must comfortably exceed real order-authoring time; polling never refreshes it by design. |
| `MAX_OPEN_MATCHES_PER_PLAYER` | 3 | keep | Soft cap, enforced on create AND join. Bounds storage abuse; 3 lets a playtest juggle a stuck match plus a fresh one. |
| Join-code length / alphabet | 8 chars, `A–Z2–9` minus `0/O/1/I/L` (31 glyphs) | keep | Read-aloud safe; 31⁸ ≈ 8.5e11 codes keeps collisions negligible for the 3-attempt create loop. |
| `CODE_CREATE_ATTEMPTS` | 3 | keep | Collision retries before giving up; at the code space above this should never be observed. |
| Orders per submission (zod cap, hard-coded) | 8 | keep | Must stay ≥ ships per side (2); headroom for larger scenario variants without a contract change. |
| Server seed range (hard-coded) | `randomInt(0, 2147483647)` → 0…2³¹−2 | keep | `crypto.randomInt`'s maximum is exclusive, so 2³¹−1 itself is unreachable; effectively the full non-negative int32 space minus one value, with no gameplay effect beyond variety. |

## Order-entry surface (`unity/.../Services/PvpOrderSession.cs`)

| Knob | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TurnDeltaStep` | 15° per press | keep | Matches the engine's 15°-per-point angle penalty granularity, so every press has a legible effect. |
| `TurnDeltaLimit` | ±90° | keep | **Schema-pinned** (`simOrderSchema`); the UI clamp must mirror the server bound. |
| `SpeedDeltaLimit` | ±2 | keep | **Schema-pinned**; same mirroring requirement. |

## Netplay client (`unity/.../UI/PvpNetplayUIController.cs`)

| Knob | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pollIntervalSeconds` (serialized) | 2 | keep | Sets worst-case "opponent resolved → I see it" latency. PlayMode tests drive `Advance(2.5f)` ticks and polling fires at `_pollDueIn <= 0`, so intervals up to and including 2.5 still poll; above 2.5 update the tests with it. |
| Verdict / status copy (hard-coded) | "VICTORY — your side wins", "DEFEAT…", "DRAW", "MATCH EXPIRED — abandoned…", "Connection hiccup… retrying", "Turn N: broadsides fly..." | keep | Placeholder voice; a copy pass can retune freely — none of these strings are test-pinned verbatim except via `Does.Contain("VICTORY")` in one PlayMode assert. |

## Generated scenes (`PvPHotseatDemoSceneBuilder` / `PvPNetplayDemoSceneBuilder`)

Both builders share the spectator demo's board material and framing
conventions; values below are hard-coded in the builders.

| Knob | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Camera `orthographicSize` / position | 8.5 @ (11, 20, 0) | keep | Battle midline sits at sim x = 110 → world x = 11 (vs 12.5 in the mission scene); same 8.5 zoom as the reviewed spectator framing. |
| Board cube | 30×1×16 @ (11, −0.55, 0) | keep | Covers the mirrored sim space at 0.1 world units per sim unit. |
| Button size / spacing / margin | 130×40, 8 gap, 20 edge | keep | Eight order buttons fit one row at default game-view widths. |
| Button fill color | (0.15, 0.25, 0.4, 0.9) | keep | Muted navy; readable TMP white labels without competing with the board. |
| Order/HUD label layout | hud 60h @ −10; status 40h @ −75; order panel 140h @ 70 (hot-seat) / 116 (netplay) | keep | Netplay lifts the order panel above its second (menu) button row at y = 66. |
| Label / button font sizes | 18 / 16 | keep | Denser than the mission scene's 20 — the PvP HUD carries three text blocks. |
| Join-code input (netplay) | 8-char limit, LegacyRuntime 18pt, white field (0.9), gray italic "MATCH CODE" placeholder | keep | Legacy uGUI InputField keeps the interactive path off TMP; limit mirrors the server code length. |
| Hot-seat handoff copy | "Side A locked in. Hand the seat to Side B…" | keep | The interstitial is a review-mandated fairness gate; copy is free to change, the extra confirm press is not. |

## Constraints (do not tune past these)

- **Fingerprint pins:** any Scenario-section change other than
  `PVP_DEFAULT_SEED` must update the fingerprint constant in
  `tests/pvpScenario.test.ts`, the same constant in the Unity EditMode
  suite, and `PvpScenario.cs` — and re-derive the empirical fixtures:
  the seed-11 focus-fire win (vitest + the server full-match test) and
  the hold-fire turn-limit draw. Tuning only the default seed skips both
  fingerprint constants but still re-derives the fixtures, updates the
  C# `DefaultSeed` mirror, **and regenerates `PvPHotseatDemo.unity`** —
  the scene stores the bootstrap's serialized `seed`, which does not
  follow the C# default (netplay is unaffected: its seed is
  server-picked).
- **Schema mirrors:** `TurnDeltaLimit` (±90) and `SpeedDeltaLimit` (±2)
  must equal `simOrderSchema`'s bounds; the join-code input's character
  limit must equal `CODE_LENGTH`.
- **No upper bound on `turnNumber`** in the submit schema — deliberate
  (post-draw replays must reach the transaction to earn `409 match_over`;
  Codex finding on PR #54). Do not "tidy" a max back in.
- **TTL semantics:** polling must never bump `updatedAt` (idle polling
  keeping a match alive would defeat abandonment detection). The
  in-progress TTL must exceed any plausible order-authoring session.
- **Orders cap ≥ fleet size** per side, or legal submissions start
  failing validation.
- **Poll interval vs tests:** PlayMode drives 2.5s ticks and the poll
  condition is `<= 0`, so the boundary is exactly 2.5s — a poll interval
  above 2.5s silently stops polling in those tests.
- **Modifier set is a product pin**, not a knob (see Scenario table).
- Spectator playback knobs (timings, colors, bars, camera in the mission
  scene) are owned by `spectator-tuning.md`; PvP scenes inherit the
  renderer defaults automatically, and per-turn bar baselines derive from
  `PvpScenario.BuildInitialState()` so hull/sail stat changes flow into
  the bars with no extra wiring.

## Regeneration

Both PvP scenes are generated. After changing any builder value or
serialized default, rebuild via `Assets → Armada → Build PvP Hotseat
Demo Scene` / `Build PvP Netplay Demo Scene` (or batchmode
`-executeMethod PvPHotseatDemoSceneBuilder.Build` /
`PvPNetplayDemoSceneBuilder.Build`) and commit the scenes plus any new
`.meta` files. Scenario or lifecycle constant changes need no scene
rebuild — with one exception: `PVP_DEFAULT_SEED` is baked into the
hot-seat scene as the bootstrap's serialized `seed`, so seed tuning
regenerates `PvPHotseatDemo.unity` too. Everything else ripples only
through the fingerprint/fixture pins above.
